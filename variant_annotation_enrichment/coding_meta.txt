NSM	Non-synonymous missense	A coding region variation where one allele in the set changes protein peptide.
NSN	Non-synonymous nonsense	A coding region variation where one allele in the set changes to STOP codon (TER).
SYN	Synonymous	A coding region variation where one allele in the set does not change the encoded amino acid.
